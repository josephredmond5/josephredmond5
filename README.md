As a junior software engineer, I am a bootcamp graduate equipped with an extensive knowledge of key programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. I am also adept at bridging the front-end and back-end by utilizing APIs, Express.js, and performing CRUD operations with MySQL.

Currently enrolled in a full-stack web development program at Command Shift (formerly known as Manchester Codes), I am always driven by my passion for problem-solving. I approach every challenge with enthusiasm and strive to expand my skill set and deepen my understanding of technology, techniques, and achieving excellence.

I find great joy in exploring new possibilities and pushing the boundaries of my abilities. With an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and growth, I am constantly seeking out opportunities to broaden my horizons and contribute to cutting-edge projects.

In summary, my dedication to honing my skills, my ability to seamlessly connect different aspects of web development, and my passion for problem-solving make me an ideal candidate for any software engineering team. Let's embark on an exciting journey together, leveraging technology to create remarkable solutions!
